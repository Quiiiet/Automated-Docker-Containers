# Project name: Automated Docker Containers

# Overview:
The Docker Container Setup project aims to provide an automated script for setting up Docker containers based on user preferences. The script allows users to choose an operating system (Ubuntu, openSUSE, CentOS, or a custom image) and optionally install software within the container. The script handles the installation and configuration of Docker, pulls the specified Docker image, and customizes the container based on the user's choices.

# User Stories:
- As a developer, I want to easily set up Docker containers with different operating systems to test my applications in various environments.

- As a system administrator, I want a streamlined process for deploying Docker containers with specific software configurations to ensure consistent setups across multiple instances.

- As a researcher, I want the flexibility to use custom Docker images in my experiments and easily install additional software within the containers.

- As a DevOps engineer, I want to automate the setup of Docker containers, including the installation of necessary software, to improve efficiency and reduce manual configuration steps.

- As a beginner in Docker, I want a user-friendly script that guides me through the process of creating and customizing Docker containers without requiring extensive knowledge of Docker commands.
